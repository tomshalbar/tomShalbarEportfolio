      <p class="reflection-content">
        Reflecting on my first year at the University of Florida, I'm grateful
        for how much I've grown both academically and personally. As a computer
        science major, I was challenged in ways that pushed me to develop
        stronger problem-solving and time management skills. Courses introduced
        me to the foundations of programming and algorithms, setting a solid
        base for the future. Beyond the classroom, being involved in the SEC
        (Software Engineering Club) and OS (Open source) Club gave me a chance
        to connect with peers who share my interests. Through projects,
        workshops, and guest talks, I gained hands-on experience and insight
        into industry practices that go beyond textbook learning. These
        communities helped me stay motivated and excited about the field.
        Looking back, I'm proud of what I've accomplished and even more excited
        for what's ahead. My first year at UF has set a strong foundation for
        both my education and career.
